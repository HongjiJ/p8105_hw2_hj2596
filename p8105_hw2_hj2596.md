### Problem 1

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The process begins with
data import, updates variable names, and selects the columns that will
be used in later parts fo this problem. We update `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7.

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # … with 455 more rows
```

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance
as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of
rows is the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 84 × 2
##    station_name                   line           
##    <chr>                          <chr>          
##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
## # … with 74 more rows
```

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow
vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable – this logical, so
taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will
coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first
step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert
`route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from
previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and
on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes
with the required stations in rows).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 60 × 2
##    station_name                  line           
##    <chr>                         <chr>          
##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue

### Problem 2

Import and clean up trash_wheel. Created a new variable int_sports_balls
for the integer number of sports balls.

``` r
trash_wheel = readxl::read_xlsx("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
      int_sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
      year = as.numeric(year)
    )
```

Import and clean up professor_trash_wheel.

``` r
professor_trash_wheel = readxl::read_xlsx("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) 
```

Combing the two datasets above.

``` r
#add a variable before combining the two datasets
professor_trash_wheel = 
  mutate(professor_trash_wheel, trash_wheel_person = "Professor Trash Wheel")
trash_wheel= mutate(trash_wheel,
  trash_wheel_person = "Mr.Trash Wheel" )
#combining the two datasets
combined_trash_wheel =
  full_join(trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel)
```

Calculate the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
and the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020.

``` r
combined_trash_wheel %>% 
  filter(trash_wheel_person == "Professor Trash Wheel") %>% 
  pull(weight_tons) %>%
  sum()
## [1] 190.12
combined_trash_wheel %>% 
  filter(trash_wheel_person == "Mr.Trash Wheel", year == 2020) %>% 
  pull(int_sports_balls) %>%
  sum()
## [1] 856
```

The number of observations in the combined dataset is 641. The key
variable names are dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered,
int_sports_balls, trash_wheel_person. The total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 190.12 The total number of sports
balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856

### Problem 3

Import pols_month data. And clean up the data. Remove `prez_dem` and
`prez_gop` and `day` variables

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c('year','month','day'), sep = "-" , convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
     #change this to abb so that it has the same name with unemployment
     month = month.abb[month],
     president = recode(prez_dem, '0' = "gop", '1' = "dem")
  ) %>% 
  select (-day,-prez_gop,-prez_dem) 
```

Import snp data. And clean up the data. Remove the `day` variable.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(col = date, into =c ("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  mutate (year = if_else(year<16, year +2000, year +1900)) %>%
  select (-day) 
```

Import unemployment data. And clean up the data.

``` r
unemployment = read_csv( "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv" ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
  jan:dec,
  names_to = "month",
  values_to = "unemployment_rate" ) %>% 
  mutate(
     month = str_to_title(month)
  ) 
```

``` r
joined_data =
  left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year","month"))
```

The dataset `pols_month` have 822 observations(rows) and 9 cols, and the
variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem,
rep_dem, president. The years are in the range between 1947 and 2015.

The dataset `snp` have 787 observations(rows) and 3 cols, and the
variables are month, year, close. The years are in the range between
1950 and 2015.

The dataset `unemployment` have 816 observations(rows) and 3 cols, and
the variables are year, month, unemployment_rate. The years are in the
range between 1948 and 2015.

The dataset `joined_data` have 822 observations(rows) and 11 cols, and
the variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment_rate. The years are in
the range between 1947 and 2015.
